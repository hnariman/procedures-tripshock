### Planned features: 

1. Monday link shall be enough as input ( using some webscraping from link
   shall find out the Ticket name)
   Maybe: npm crawler or puppeteer (second is better option since is headless
   browser)

2. While creating PR and generating Final report shall route to additional prompt for
   changes made (which shall be multiline input or some array of changes with
   confirmation prompt after each one)

3.  Overall app shall be able to handle Github Repo, Gitlab and AWS codecommit,
   reading .env file and deciding which protocol and cli tool to use
4. App shall check if aws cli, git is installed

5. App shall be crossplatform (for now it's only Linux compatible)

6. Adding electron GUI option in future

7. Adding compatibility with Jira, Monday com API (env file), Google tasks and
   maybe gmail.
